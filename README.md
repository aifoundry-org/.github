## Hi there 👋 -- we are building an open ecosystem for AI

[AIFoundry.org](AIFoundry.org) is a community initiative to create an open ecosystem of shareable practices and technologies for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).  



## Our Vision

OWN YOUR OWN AI: private, composable and controllable AI systems at the enterprise level. 



## Our Mission

We are a community of practitioners building open-source private, composable and controllable AI systems, aiming to make local models deployment easier and more effective at different levels.

By collaborating on such system standards for everyone, we aim to reduce the complexity of the AI industry in general. 

We desire to see the industry aligned on the principles of how those systems are structured, yet allowing every company to customize its own engine or system, configured the way each specific company needs it. 

Therefore, we foster and build projects which can become engineering building blocks of such local deployment systems.



## Who We Are Here For

We support practitioners willing to benefit from AI in their work and life, specifically models and their fine-tuning and deployment, such as:

Software engineers building with open source AI technologies

Data engineers handling data for models training, fine-tuning and deployment in different ways

Academic researchers working on the latest techniques of models fine-tuning, such as continuous training, and models local usage, such as quantization

Funky hardware companies designing semiconductors, processors and chips, and optimizing software for better hardware utilization

CTOs defining their companies technical strategy

CIOs strategically looking for a new infrastructure and not limiting to the existing one



## Here are some ideas to get you started:

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
