## Hi there 👋 -- we are building an open ecosystem for AI

[AIFoundry.org](AIFoundry.org) is a community initiative to create an open ecosystem of shareable practices and technologies for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).  The goal is to allow everyone to own their own AI.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
